# Hi, I'm Manuel 👋

## 🚀 Transitioning: Financial Services Professional → Data Analyst → Data Engineer → ML Engineer → LLM Engineer

I'm on a **37-month journey** combining **finance, trading, data science, and AI** to build intelligent trading systems.

**Current Focus (Stage 1 - Months 1-5):**  
📊 Securing my first **Data Analyst role** while building a unique skill set at the intersection of finance and technology.

---

## 💼 What Makes Me Different

🎯 **Rare Skill Combination:**
- 📈 **Finance Background:** Financial services professional + active trader (swing/day trading)
- 🐍 **Technical Skills:** Python, SQL, Data Analysis, Statistics
- 🤖 **AI Focus:** Building toward ML & LLM Engineering
- 💰 **Domain Expertise:** Market structure, trading algorithms, quantitative finance

**The Edge:** Most data analysts don't understand trading. Most traders can't code. I'm building both.
