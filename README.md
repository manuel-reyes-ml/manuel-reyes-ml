## 💼 What Makes Me Different

Most entry-level candidates have tutorial projects. **I have production code with measurable business impact.**

### **My Unique Position:**

| Most Candidates | What I Bring |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Tutorial projects | ✅ **Production ETL system** (live, saving $15K/year) |
| No domain expertise | ✅ **15+ years business data experience** across multiple industries |
| Basic skills | ✅ **4 years finance + 6 years trading** domain expertise |
| Vague portfolios | ✅ **Public code** with synthetic data (privacy-conscious) |
| Scattered projects | ✅ **One flagship project** evolving through 5 career stages |
| Unclear trajectory | ✅ **Systematic 37-month roadmap** to Senior LLM Engineer |
| Private learning | ✅ **Building in public** (transparent, accountable) |

**The Combination:** Deep domain expertise (business data and operations) + Production systems + Flagship project with statistical rigor + Clear growth trajectory = **Immediate value + long-term potential**

## 🚀 Production Highlight

### 🧾 [1099 Reconciliation ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/1099_reconciliation_pipeline)
**Status:** ✅ Live in production | 🌐 Public repository with synthetic data

**Business Context:**  
Manual reconciliation of retirement plan distributions took 4-6 hours weekly, was error-prone, and blocked critical 1099-R tax reporting at Daybright Financial.

**Technical Solution:**  
Automated Python ETL pipeline extracting, transforming, validating, and reconciling data between two financial systems (Relius and Matrix).

**Measurable Impact:**
- ⚡ **95% time reduction** (4-6 hours → 15 minutes weekly)
- 💰 **$15,000+ annual savings** in labor costs  
- 📊 **10x scalability** (300+ accounts vs. 30 manual capacity)
- ✅ **Zero errors** since deployment (comprehensive validation)
- 🔒 **Production-ready code** visible on GitHub (smart privacy with synthetic data)

**Tech Stack:** Python • pandas • openpyxl • Excel • matplotlib • data validation • faker

## 🏆 Flagship Project

### 📈 [Attention-Flow Catalyst](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/attention-flow-catalyst)
**Status:** 🚧 Phase 1A Active | 🌐 Public Repository

> **Research Question:** Which trigger or combination best predicts +10% price moves within 3 trading days?

**One project, five stages, complete career demonstration.**

Predictive trigger analysis system for small-cap stocks using alternative data sources. This flagship project evolves through all 5 stages of my career transition.

**System Architecture:**
```
Stock Screener → Data Pipeline → Trigger Detection → Backtest Engine → Signal Generator
     │               │                │                  │                │
  50 stocks      3yr history      T1-T4 signals      Rank by          Daily
  (<$5, small    per ticker      + combinations      hit rate         watchlist
  float, listed)                                                      
```

**Stock Screening:** Price < $5 | Listed only (no OTC) | Small float | Strong sector (auto-detected)

**Triggers Being Tested:**

| ID | Trigger | Data Source | What It Detects |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **T1** | SEC Form 4 Insider Buy | edgartools | Smart money activity |
| **T2** | Wikipedia Attention Spike | Wikipedia API | Public attention surge |
| **T3** | News Mention Spike | RSS/GDELT | Media coverage |
| **T4** | Volume Accumulation | yfinance | RVOL, OBV, accumulation patterns |

**Combination Testing:** All individual, 2-trigger, 3-trigger, and 4-trigger combinations with sector & index context filters.

**Project Evolution Through 5 Career Stages:**

| Stage | Version | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **1 (DA)** | v2.0-v3.0 | Backtest engine | Trigger leaderboard, signal generator |
| **2 (DE)** | v4.0 | Cloud scale | 500+ tickers, Airflow, AWS |
| **3 (ML)** | v5.0 | Predictions | XGBoost/LSTM ensemble |
| **4 (LLM)** | v6.0 | AI Assistant | Natural language interface |
| **5 (Sr)** | v7.0 | Production | Monetization ($2-50K/mo) |

**Why This Project Stands Out:**
- ✅ **Dynamic screening** — Program finds stocks automatically
- ✅ **Real SEC data** — Form 4 insider transactions via edgartools
- ✅ **Statistical rigor** — Proper backtesting with combination testing
- ✅ **Volume analysis** — RVOL, OBV, accumulation patterns
- ✅ **Domain expertise** — 6 years trading knowledge codified

**Tech Stack:** Python • SQLite • pandas • edgartools • yfinance • Wikipedia API • matplotlib

## 💡 Why I'm Making This Transition

I've worked with data my entire career—manufacturing operations, bookkeeping, financial reporting, financial services, and 6 years of active trading. One truth became undeniable: **data-driven decisions consistently outperform gut feeling.**

I watched companies make million-dollar mistakes by ignoring their numbers. I saw traders succeed or fail based purely on their data analysis discipline. The pattern was crystal clear.

But I hit a ceiling: **I could analyze data brilliantly, but I couldn't build the automated systems to scale these insights.** I couldn't create the real-time pipelines, ML models, or AI assistants I envisioned.

So I'm building them myself—following a systematic 37-month path from Data Analyst to Senior LLM Engineer. I'm doing it publicly because career transformation shouldn't be mysterious—it should inspire others to do the same.

**The Flagship Project Approach:** Instead of building scattered tutorial projects, I'm building ONE project (Attention-Flow Catalyst) that evolves through all 5 career stages—demonstrating depth, not breadth.

## 💭 Building in Public Philosophy

**Why share everything openly?**

✅ **Transparency:** Real learning is messy—showing actual process, not just polished results  
✅ **Accountability:** Public commits = public commitment (can't fake progress)  
✅ **Community:** Others learn from my journey, I learn from theirs  
✅ **Portfolio:** This profile IS proof of ability, work ethic, and trajectory  
✅ **Authenticity:** Career transitions should be documented honestly

**What makes this different:**
- Not just completing courses → Enhancing exercises beyond requirements
- Not just learning → Deploying production systems with measurable impact
- Not just building projects → One flagship project with statistical rigor
- Not just showing code → Explaining business context and ROI
- Not staying private → Sharing progress, challenges, and breakthroughs
