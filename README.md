## 💼 What Makes Me Different

Most entry-level candidates have tutorial projects. **I have production code with measurable business impact.**

🏆 **Unique Value Proposition:**
- ✅ **Production ETL system** deployed and running (95% time reduction, $15K/year savings)
- ✅ **Public code** for review (smart data privacy with synthetic test data)
- ✅ **15+ years data expertise** (manufacturing operations, bookkeeping, financial reporting, business operations)
- ✅ **5+ years in financial services** (business operations, retirement plans, compliance, reconciliation)
- ✅ **6+ years trading experience** (swing/day trading, technical analysis, quantitative strategies)
- ✅ **Systematic learning path** (37-month roadmap from DA to Senior LLM Engineer)
- ✅ **Building in public** (transparent progress, consistent commits)

**The Combination:** Domain expertise (data + finance + trading) + Production experience + Technical skills + Clear growth trajectory

## 💡 Why I'm Making This Change

I've worked with data my entire professional career—manufacturing operations, bookkeeping, financial reporting, financial services, last 6 years actively trading. Through all of this, one truth became undeniable: **data-driven decisions consistently beat gut feeling**. I've watched companies make million-dollar mistakes ignoring their numbers, and traders succeed or fail based purely on their data analysis. The pattern was crystal clear.

But I hit a ceiling: I could analyze data brilliantly and spot patterns, but **I couldn't build the automated systems to scale these insights**. I couldn't create the real-time pipelines, ML models, or AI assistants I envisioned. So I'm building them myself—Week 1 of a systematic 37-month journey from Data Analyst to Senior LLM Engineer. I'm doing it in public, sharing every step, because career transformation shouldn't be mysterious—it should inspire others to do the same.

## 🚀 Featured: Production Project

### 🧾 [1099 Reconciliation ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/manuel-reyes-ml/1099_reconciliation_pipeline)
**Status:** ✅ Live in production at Daybright Financial | 🌐 Public repository

**The Business Problem:**  
Manual reconciliation of retirement plan distributions took 4-6 hours weekly, was error-prone, and blocked critical 1099-R tax reporting.

**The Solution:**  
Built automated Python ETL pipeline extracting, transforming, validating, and reconciling data from two financial systems (Relius and Matrix).

**Business Impact:**
- ⚡ **95% time reduction** (4-6 hours → 15 minutes weekly)
- 💰 **$15K+ annual savings** in labor costs  
- 📊 **10x scalability** (handles 300+ accounts vs. 30 manual capacity)
- ✅ **Zero errors** since deployment (comprehensive validation)

**Why It's Public:**  
Uses synthetic test data (Python `faker` module) demonstrating professional data governance—full code review possible while maintaining client privacy.

**Tech Stack:** Python • pandas • openpyxl • Excel • matplotlib • data validation • faker

## 💭 My Philosophy

### **Why I'm Different:**

**Most Candidates:**
```
✓ Tutorial projects
✓ Online course completions
✓ Basic Python/SQL knowledge
✗ No production experience
✗ No domain expertise
✗ No measurable impact
```

**What I Bring:**
```
✓ Tutorial projects (enhanced beyond requirements)
✓ Multiple certifications (in progress)
✓ Advanced Python/SQL proficiency
✓ Production ETL system (live, public code)
✓ 10+ years data + 8 years finance + 6 years trading
✓ Real business impact (95% efficiency, $15K savings)
✓ Clear growth trajectory (37-month plan)
✓ Building in public (accountability + transparency)
```

### **The Value Proposition:**

> "I'm not just learning Python from tutorials. I've deployed a production system saving my company 20 hours/month. I understand data deeply, think quantitatively about markets, and I'm systematically building toward advanced AI/ML skills. **The code is public, the impact is measurable, and the trajectory is clear.**"

### **Building in Public:**
- **Transparency:** Real learning is messy—showing actual process, not just results
- **Accountability:** Public commits = public commitment
- **Community:** Learning from others, sharing knowledge
- **Portfolio:** This profile IS proof of ability, work ethic, and growth
